# MemeMe
MemeMe is a funny photo editor that let you create and share Memes with your friends. You can add photos from the album or from the camera and customize it with a top and bottom text. You can share or save the Meme, and review it later in an overview (the overview can be switched between a TableView and a CollectionView) or in detail if you select an entry in the overview.

## Installation

No special prerequisites required. You just need an IDE (preferably Xcode) and clone the source code:
